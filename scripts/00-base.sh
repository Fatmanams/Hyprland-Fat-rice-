#
# What this does:
#   1. Enables [multilib] (needed for lib32-mangohud / Steam's wine deps).
#   2. Sets MAKEFLAGS to -j$(nproc) and enables ccache in /etc/makepkg.conf
#      — affects AUR builds done later by 10-aur.sh.
#   3. Installs the official-repo portion of the rice from pacman.
#   4. Installs the shared language-server stack. These are plain
#      binaries on $PATH, NOT editor plugins: Zed discovers them itself,
#      and Emacs drives them via eglot (in Emacs core since 29 — no
#      package manager needed, which is why config/emacs/init.el can
#      stay third-party-free). config/nvim/init.lua deliberately does
#      NOT wire LSP today; the servers cost it nothing by being there.
#      The HTML/CSS/JSON/ESLint servers are AUR-only
#      (vscode-langservers-extracted) and are built by 10-aur.sh.
#   5. Post-install setup: xdg user dirs, bluetooth.service, ufw baseline,
#      ClamAV freshclam (antivirus signature autoupdate).
#   6. GPU driver layer — NVIDIA proprietary or Intel/AMD Mesa.
#   7. Optional: sets the CPU governor to `performance` via cpupower
#      (desktop gaming rig tradeoff — see the block's own comment).
#   8. Optional: installs Emacs (emacs-wayland — the PGTK/native-Wayland
#      build) as a Zed/nvim alternative IDE.
#
# Run this as a normal user (it will sudo internally where needed).

echo "==> [7/8] CPU performance governor (cpupower) — desktop gaming tradeoff"
# Installs `cpupower` (official extra) and sets the scaling governor to
# `performance`. Read this comment before accepting — it's a deliberate
# tradeoff, not a "free speed":
#   + lower input latency, more consistent frame times in games
#   - the CPU spends less time in deep idle, so idle/light loads run
#     hotter and the fans spin up sooner. Reasonable for a desktop
#     gaming box; NOT something to silently reuse on a laptop config
#     (battery). Reuse this rice on a laptop? Remove this block or
#     flip the governor to `schedutil`/`powersave`.
#
# Driver reality (verified against the ArchWiki "CPU frequency scaling"
# page, 2026-08): on modern AMD Zen (incl. the Ryzen 5 PRO 4650G this
# rice targets) the kernel may load `amd_pstate` in *active* (EPP) mode,
# where `performance`/`powersave` become an energy-preference HINT to
# the hardware's autonomous governor rather than a hard frequency lock
# (different from the classic acpi-cpufreq hard-governor model). We set
# `performance` either way — the literal is accepted by both drivers —
# but the *effect* differs. Verify on the target with:
#   cpupower frequency-info | grep -i driver
#   cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_driver
#
# We do NOT disable Spectre/Meltdown mitigations (mitigations=off) here —
# that's a real security tradeoff this rice declines to make by default.
# It's left as a manual, off-by-default kernel-cmdline opt-in you'd add
# yourself in /etc/default/grub or /boot/loader/entries, not something
# this script touches.
