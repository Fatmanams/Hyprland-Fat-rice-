# AGENTS.md

Opencode-facing instructions for this repository. Read this before
making any change. The user-facing readme is `README.md` — this file
is the contract the agent must follow.

This rice is authored from a Windows box (file paths in commit messages
/ `git status` may show `D:\linux rice`) and pushed via `gh CLI`. It
targets **Arch Linux** (single-monitor, GPU-agnostic NVIDIA/Intel/AMD).
Scripts run on Arch; do not assume Windows tools exist on the target.

## Package policy (inviolable)

1. **Official repos first.** If a package is in `pacman -S` (any repo:
   core, extra, multilib), it comes from there. No building from source
   when an official package exists.
2. **No AUR helpers** (`paru`, `yay`, etc.). **No `curl | bash`
   installers**, ever — including upstream one-liner install scripts
   (`curl -f https://zed.dev/install.sh | sh` is forbidden; use the
   AUR pkg instead).
3. **AUR-only packages** go through `scripts/10-aur.sh`:
   - `git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/<pkg>.git`
   - print the full PKGBUILD with line numbers for human review
   - scan for `curl|bash` / suspicious source URLs (`pastebin|ipfs|ngrok`)
   - wait for explicit `[y/N]` confirmation before building
   - `makepkg -Cso` (clean + sync deps + build, **NO `-i`** — build only)
   - `repo-add` the produced `*.pkg.tar.zst` into the local repo at
     `/var/cache/pacman/localrepo` (registered into `/etc/pacman.conf`
     as `[localrepo]` with `SigLevel = Optional TrustAll`)
   - install via `sudo pacman -S <pkg>` from that local repo
4. **Static-asset / no-build repos** (like `sddm-astronaut-theme`) use a
   bare `git clone` straight from upstream into the documented install
   path (e.g. `/usr/share/sddm/themes/...`). Don't manufacture a PKGBUILD
   wrapper when there's nothing to compile. `scripts/20-sddm.sh` is the
   sole current example.
5. **Up-front AUR-only audit.** Before any change that adds or removes
   a package, scan the full package list and list every AUR-only
   dependency in the PR description (or commit message, if pushing
   direct) — so the review/build step is visible, never silent mid-task.

### AUR-only packages currently in this build

`scripts/10-aur.sh` is the source of truth. As of last audit:

| Package                | Notes                                                              |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `eww`                  | Rust build. Many crates from crates.io.                            |
| `python-pywal16`       | Active fork. Official `python-pywal` is the dead one — don't swap.|
| `bibata-cursor-theme`  | Cursor theme. Has install hooks; review before approving.          |
| `wlogout`              | Wayland logout menu, GTK3.                                         |
| `zed`                  | Large Rust project. **Review PKGBUILD carefully** — may fetch      |
|                        | release assets at build time.                                      |
| `brave-bin`            | Precompiled Brave .deb repackaged; downloads from Brave's signed   |
|                        | CDN (not curl\|bash). Read the PKGBUILD anyway.                    |
| `mpvpaper`             | Animated wallpaper daemon. Pinned GitHub release tarball + b2sum,  |
|                        | meson build, deps libmpv/wayland (mpv auto-pulled). No red flags.  |
| `vscode-langservers-extracted` | HTML/CSS/JSON/ESLint language servers for Zed + Emacs      |
|                        | eglot. npm registry tarball + sha256sum, `npm i -g` into `$pkgdir` |
|                        | with the cache confined to `$srcdir`. No build(), no hooks. The    |
|                        | rest of the LSP stack is official-repo (`00-base.sh` step 4).      |

When a package leaves AUR for official repos (the trend), **remove it
from `10-aur.sh` and add it to `00-base.sh`'s `pacman -S` list**. Don't
keep building it from AUR "to be safe" — that violates rule #1.

### Packages often mistaken for AUR-only (now in official repos)

Do not add to `10-aur.sh` — they are already in `00-base.sh`:
`rofi-wayland`, `ghostty`, `swww`, `swaync`, `cliphist`, `nwg-look`,
`kvantum`, `kvantum-qt5`, `gamemode`, `gamescope`, `mangohud`,
`lib32-mangohud`, `python-pywal` (old fork — we use `pywal16` by choice).

---

## Build speed settings (already applied by `00-base.sh`)

- `/etc/makepkg.conf`: `MAKEFLAGS="-j$(nproc)"`
- `/etc/makepkg.conf`: `BUILDENV=(!distcc !color !ccache check !sign)` —
  `ccache` installed from pacman and wired into BUILDENV
- Local repo at `/var/cache/pacman/localrepo`, name `localrepo`,
  registered into `/etc/pacman.conf` once by `10-aur.sh`'s
  `setup_local_repo()` function

Do not invent a new build pipeline. Don't build ad-hoc in `/tmp`.
Every AUR-only build goes through `scripts/10-aur.sh`'s `build_one()`.

When adding a new component, mirror this structure: a top-level dir
under `config/<component>/` for the dotfiles, an `exec-once` line in
`hyprland.conf` to start it, and — *if* and only if there's no
official-repo equivalent — an entry in `scripts/10-aur.sh`'s
`PACKAGES=(...)` array.

Qt apps run native Wayland via `env = QT_QPA_PLATFORM, wayland;xcb` in
`hyprland.conf` (the `;xcb` fallback is required — some Qt apps fail to
start without it). `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME, qt6ct` picks the theme; the
two vars are independent, keep both.

---

## Skip-git-appendix

The agent should never invoke the following on its own without an
explicit user request:

- `git push`
- `git commit` (touching any file the user said "keep going" about is
  fine; the commit is what's gated)
- `gh pr create` / `gh pr merge` / `gh pr close`
- force-push (`git push --force`) — only when the target branch is an
  empty-repo `main` you're initializing, never otherwise

`gh` is installed at `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe` on this
machine. Use `& "C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe" <args>` from
PowerShell (the call operator is required — bare quoted paths won't
parse as commands in PS).

Auth: `gh auth status` confirms you're logged in. If a `gh` command
errors with auth, **stop and ask the user to run `gh auth login`**
interactively — do not store tokens or accept PASTED tokens in chat.

---

## Lint / verify / test

There is no test suite. What verifying exists (also enforced on push/PR
by `.github/workflows/lint.yml`):

1. **Bash syntax check** on every script edit:
   ```
   bash -n scripts/00-base.sh
   bash -n scripts/10-aur.sh
   bash -n scripts/20-sddm.sh
   bash -n scripts/30-dotfiles.sh
   bash -n scripts/40-gaming.sh
   ```
2. **JSON validity** on swaync + wlogout configs (with `jq`):
   ```
   jq . config/swaync/config.json        # has a // comment line — strip first if jq is strict
   jq . config/wlogout/layout           # same
   ```
3. **Conf file sanity** (the conv comment header on swaync's
   `config.json` and wlogout's `layout` is **deliberate** — keeps the
   `write` tool's JSON auto-detect from misparsing the file content as
   an object literal at session-time. Don't remove it without testing).

If you add a new script, structure, or behavior, run the relevant
syntax checks before committing, and add it to the lint workflow's
coverage if it isn't already (CI catches it otherwise).

---

## Color palette contract

Color theming is **pywal16-driven, single source of truth**. The flow:

1. `hyprland.conf` runs `wal -i ~/.config/hypr/wallpaper.jpg` at session
   start when the wallpaper exists; otherwise it applies the selected
   preset theme via `switch-theme.sh` (see step 7)
2. pywal16 writes `~/.cache/wal/colors-waybar.css` (stock pywal16 template,
   GTK `@define-color` syntax), `~/.cache/wal/colors-rofi.rasi` (from the
   **custom** user template this repo ships), and
   `~/.cache/wal/colors-wal.vim`
3. The GTK-CSS components (`waybar/style.css`, `swaync/style.css`,
   `eww/eww.scss`, `wlogout/style.css`) all
   `@import "../../.cache/wal/colors-waybar.css";` at the top. Do **not**
   point them at `colors.css` — that file is web-CSS (`:root { --var }`)
   which GTK CSS's `@name` references cannot resolve.
4. `rofi/config.rasi` imports `~/.cache/wal/colors-rofi.rasi`, generated
   from the custom template at `config/wal/templates/colors-rofi.rasi`
   (raw `@colorN` scheme matching this rice's design). The stock
   `colors-rofi-dark.rasi` was deliberately NOT used — its semantic names
   don't match. `config/wal/templates/` MUST stay covered by
   `30-dotfiles.sh`'s blanket `config/` install step so the template
   reaches `~/.config/wal/templates/` where `wal` reads it.
5. Neovim sources `~/.cache/wal/colors-wal.vim` at editor open (falls back
   to a baked Catppuccin Mocha palette if pywal hasn't run yet). Emacs
   (opt-in) does the same with `~/.cache/wal/colors.el`, generated from
   the custom template at `config/wal/templates/colors.el` — same
   fallback, same `config/wal/templates/` install requirement as item 4.
6. Ghostty is the outlier — its config bakes Catppuccin Mocha because
   ghostty doesn't `@import` CSS. A post-wal hook that regenerates a
   ghostty colors.conf from pywal is a documented TODO in `README.md`'s
   Tree section. **Do not silently edit ghostty's color palette** to
   match the other components without addressing this TODO properly.
7. Preset themes (used when no wallpaper is set): `config/hypr/themes/`
   ships `mocha` / `gruvbox` / `tokyonight` as pre-generated copies of
   pywal's own output files; `config/hypr/switch-theme.sh` (SUPER+SHIFT+T
   cycles) copies them into `~/.cache/wal/` and records the choice in
   `~/.cache/wal/current-theme`. Rules: presets are applied ONLY via the
   switcher; `wal -i` still wins whenever `wallpaper.jpg` exists; never
   hand-edit files inside `~/.cache/wal/` (they're regenerated); when
   adding a preset, keep all five file formats (colors-waybar.css,
   colors-rofi.rasi, colors-wal.vim, colors.el, colors.sh) in sync AND
   listed in `switch-theme.sh`'s `cp -f` — a format missing from either
   place leaves that consumer on a stale palette after a switch; ghostty
   and VLC stay unthemed by presets (ghostty per item 6's TODO).

When adding a new themed component, follow the CSS `@import` pattern.
Don't hardcode hex colors that should match the dynamic palette.

---

## Monitor + wallpaper contract (must NOT regress)

- `config/hypr/hyprland.conf` ships with `monitor=,preferred,auto,1`
  — this is a **documented stopgap**, not the committed config. **Do
  not** commit a "real" value; the user is expected to run
  `hyprctl monitors` after first boot and replace it. The README's
  "Mandatory first-boot TODOs" section is the contract.
- `config/hypr/hyprpaper.conf` ships with `wallpaper = eDP-1, ...`
  where `eDP-1` is a placeholder. Same deal — user replaces with the
  real monitor name. **Don't** run `hyprctl monitors` from a script to
  auto-fill the line; the stopgap is intentional.
- The wallpaper path `~/.config/hypr/wallpaper.jpg` is a TODO the user
  fills in after `30-dotfiles.sh` runs. **Don't** vendor a wallpaper
  binary into this repo.
- Animated wallpaper: `hyprland.conf` starts **mpvpaper** (AUR) pointed
  at `~/.config/hypr/wallpaper.mp4` — also a user-side TODO, same rules:
  `eDP-1` in the mpvpaper line is a placeholder for the real monitor
  name, **don't** auto-fill it, **don't** vendor a video binary.
  `hyprpaper` stays installed and wired as the commented fallback line;
  `hyprpaper.conf` is the static-fallback config. Keep both paths
  working — swapping between them must stay a one-line comment toggle.

---

## GPU-agnostic contract (must NOT regress)

The rice works on either NVIDIA proprietary or Intel/AMD Mesa without
the user re-editing configs. Mechanism (see README "GPU compatibility"
section for the user-facing version):

1. `scripts/00-base.sh` detects vendor via `lspci` and installs the
   right driver stack with a confirmation prompt.
2. `config/hypr/hyprland.conf` has a commented `# NVIDIA:` env block
   at the bottom of the `# ---- Environment` section. Default
   (uncommented) = Intel/AMD mode. NVIDIA users uncomment that block.
   Don't replace this with an auto-detect at runtime — Hyprland's
   `env =` lines are parsed at config-load, not at exec-once time, so
   conditional envs cannot work.
3. `config/hypr/gpu-env.sh` is the runtime shim for app-level env vars
   (`__GL_*`, `LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME`, `VDPAU_DRIVER`, `Mesa_*`). User
   sources it from `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`. Auto-detects at shell start.
4. README documents NVIDIA kernel cmdline requirements:
   `nvidia_drm.modeset=1 nvidia_drm.fbdev=1`.

When changing GPU-related env vars, update **all three** layers in
lockstep, or the rice regresses on one of the two vendors without an
obvious failure mode.

---

## Display manager rollback contract (must NOT regress)

`scripts/20-sddm.sh` does the following before touching SDDM config:

- Snapshots `/etc/sddm.conf.d` and `/usr/share/sddm/themes` to
  `/root/sddm-snap.<TS>/`
- Records the previously-working `Current=` value in
  `/root/sddm-snap.<TS>/PREVIOUS_Current.txt`
- Does NOT remove plasma/kde session entries (so Plasma is always a
  fallback login in SDDM's session picker)

The README's "Rolling back if SDDM crashes" section documents the
TTY-based recovery procedure. Don't break this pattern — keep the KDE
fallback entry intact, keep the snapshot-before-change ethos, keep the
rollback procedure in the README in sync with the actual script.

---

## Sudoedit / $EDITOR gotcha (don't regress)

`$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL` are set to `zed --wait` in `hyprland.conf`.
This works for `git commit`, `crontab -e`, and most terminal tools. It
**does not** work cleanly for `sudoedit`/`visudo` because Zed is a
Wayland GUI app launched from a root process — it can't connect to
the user's wayland socket. The README documents the fallback
(`sudoedit -e nano` — `nano` is installed by `00-base.sh` specifically
for this).

Don't change `$EDITOR` to a TUI editor "to fix sudoedit" without
asking — the current setup is the user's explicit choice ("zed for
python c c++ lua java rust json"), and `nano` is the documented escape
hatch for the corner cases.

---

## Commit / PR style

- Commit message body wrapped at ~70 chars, paragraphs separated by
  blank lines, no `git commit -m` for non-trivial commits — write
  a real multi-line message.
- Don't squash context: scripts changed, dotfiles changed, and
  README changes can all be one commit if they're coherent (e.g.
  "add new component" — installs it, configs it, documents it). If
  the user added a feature and you also need to update the AUR audit
  table, those belong in the same commit.
- Always update the README's "AUR-only packages" audit table when
  the AUR set changes. The table is the rule-5 contract.
- **No emojis** in commit messages or file contents unless the user
  asks for them.
- Don't add comments to existing code unless asked, and the comments
  that *are* in the configs/scripts are intentional documentation
  (rollback procedures, gotchas, the gpu-env.sh vendor detection, the
  sudoedit explanation in `hyprland.conf`, the `// swaync config.`
  comment header that protects the JSON file from the write tool's
  autodetection). Don't strip them as "cleanup".

---

## "Keep going" semantics

When the user says "keep going" without further specification, interpret
it as "continue from where you left off and finish the in-flight task."
That means:

- finish the file you were writing
- finish the commit you were staging
- finish the PR description you were drafting
- run the syntax checks (`bash -n`, `jq .`) on anything changed
- push to the same branch / open the PR / merge per the existing flow

It does **not** mean "start a new feature" or "invent the next task."
If the in-flight task is already done and the user says "keep going,"
**ask** what they want next rather than guessing.
