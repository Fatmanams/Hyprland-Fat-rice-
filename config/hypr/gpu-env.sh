# This file AUTO-DETECTS the running GPU at shell start and only sets
# the env vars that matter for that vendor. Adding/removing env vars
# affects what's inherited by games launched from Steam/Proton, native
# Vulkan games, and any CLI tool that respects $LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME,
# $MESA_*, $NV_*, $__GL_*, $VK_* etc.
#
# Detection: looks for the running GPU by parsing `lspci` (run once below;
# plain output, NOT `lspci -nn` — with -nn the class code is inserted
# between the controller name and the colon ("VGA compatible controller
# [0300]: ..."), which breaks name-based greps).
# Both `lspci` and `glxinfo` are installed by 00-base.sh (pciutils is
# a base dep; glxinfo comes from `mesa-demos` — added to 00-base).
